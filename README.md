# mc2515
RP2530 CAN controller library

This code is based on xl2515 code I have found on the internet, it improves that code signicantly:
both CAN RX registers are used insted of only one in the orginal, diagnostics routines are added (error flags, error count and so on), non starndard mode routines are added.
